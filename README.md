## “The future is now!”

“Have a tough calculation you need done? Why not use the brains of your fellow man to help solve the problem. Literally.”

Make money by connecting willing subjects to the calculation contracts you have coming in. The faster you complete them, the better. You might want to keep an eye on the mental health of your subjects though, you don’t want to fry their brains right? Or maybe you do.

Just let them relax for a bit. And then they’ll be back again.

## How to play

Left click & drag to move around subjects or contracts

Right click & drag between subjects and contracts to connect them

Right click on a connection to remove it

Note that subjects only stay for a short while before leaving.

## Pro-tip

Subjects further up a chain gets burnt out slower.

## Known issues

Somewhat rarely the game crashes, currently being investigated
